## Design

## Shoes microservice

In this project, shoes microservice manages shoes and shoe bins. In shoes context, I created a copy of the bin model (named BinVO) to be able to use bin models' data as in wardrope microservice. Shoe and BinVO models work together to be able to display shoe list, delete choosen shoe and create a new shoe.


## Hats microservice

Explain your models and integration with the wardrobe
microservice, here.
