Team:

## Design

Wardropify is an app for manufacturers to track their hats and shoes and their locations and bins. Locations and bins were in wardrope api and we created BinVO and LocationVO models to be able to use these models' data.
In the main page there are hats (hat list), shoes(shoe list), new shoe (for creating a new shoe) and new hat (for creating a new hat) pages. We used bootstrap for delete and create buttons. Also the app is a single page application.

## Shoes microservice

In this project, shoes microservice manages shoes and shoe bins. In shoes context, I created a copy of the bin model (named BinVO) to be able to use bin models' data as in wardrope microservice. Shoe and BinVO models work together to be able to display shoe list, delete choosen shoe and create a new shoe.
